# AI-Music-Assistant
Built using Python and Streamlit, the application offers features such as mood-based music recommendations, music search, lyrics analysis, and a music theory helper—all in one interface.
Project Description:

The AI Music Assistant offers four major functionalities:

1. Music Recommendations

Users can enter their current mood (e.g., “relaxed”, “sad”, “happy”) and optionally select a preferred genre. Based on the input, Gemini AI generates a curated list of five songs with artist names, tailored to the user’s emotional and musical preferences.

2. Music Search

This feature lets users search for any song, artist, or album using keywords. The app fetches top results from Spotify, including song title, artist name, release year, and placeholder genre information, and displays them in a clean, card-style format.

3. Lyrics Analysis

With this tool, users can paste any song lyrics and select what they want to analyze—whether it’s the overall meaning, themes, literary devices, or emotional tone. The Gemini AI then provides a deep and detailed explanation of the lyrics, making this ideal for music students, fans, or analysts.

4. Music Theory Helper

Users can ask any music theory-related question such as chord progressions, scales, or song structure. Gemini responds with a simplified yet informative explanation, often accompanied by examples, making it easier for beginners and learners to understand complex concepts.
